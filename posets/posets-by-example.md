Posting this as someone who learns best from concrete examples and geometric representations, on the basis that trying to explain something is a good way to test one's understanding.  I ask forbearance from those with more natural mathematical ability.  Corrections or comments gratefully received.

First, a picture:



Let's consider the subject matter of completing tasks.  Assume order means "must be completed before": so \\(x \le y\\) means "task \\(x\\) must be completed before task \\(y\\)".  Now for some examples

## Example 1 - no order

Consider cleaning the house.  Let's assume there are 3 rooms: bathroom, bedroom and kitchen.  To clean the house, we need to clean all three rooms.  It doesn't matter what order they're cleaned in: there's no dependence.
